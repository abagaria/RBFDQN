<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2" data-line-end="3">Below, I explain steps necessary for running RBFDQN. Note that I assume you are on OSX, but you basically need to follow similar steps on other platforms. </p>

<p >I highly recommend using Anaconda for creating and managing virtual environments. You can download Anaconda distribution from <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section">here</a>. Download and install the Python 3.7 version.</p>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="4" data-line-end="6">We now need to create an Anaconda virtual environment. We also need to specify the version of Python used for our new environment. I strongly recommend using Python 3.5.6 for this project. I also recommend choosing a descriptive name for your virtual environment, such as RBFDQN_env. On Mac, open a terminal tab. You can create such a virtual environment using the following command:<br>
<strong> conda create -n RBFDQN_env python=3.5.6 anaconda</p> </strong>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="7" data-line-end="9">Before installing Python packages, you need to install Mujoco. The first step is to download Mujoco itself from <a href="https://www.roboti.us/index.html">here</a>. I highly recommend that you download mjpro131. You need to create a folder using the following command:<br>
<strong> mkdir ~/.mujoco/</p></strong>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="10" data-line-end="11">Now put mjpro131 in the mujoco folder you just created. Note that you also need to get a Mujoco key and put the key inside the mujoco folder. You can get the key using one of the several ways outlined <a href="https://www.roboti.us/license.html">here</a>.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="12" data-line-end="14">You now want to activate your Anaconda virtual environment, and install relevant packages. To do so, use the following command:<br>
<strong> source activate RBFDQN_env  </strong> </p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="15" data-line-end="17">The last line on your terminal should now be starting with (RBFDQN_env). This tells you that the environment is activated. You can always deactivate the environment using the command:<br>
<strong>conda deactivate</strong></p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="18" data-line-end="20">You now need to install Open AI Gym. To do so, use the following command:<br>
<strong>pip install gym[all]==0.9.1</strong></p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="21" data-line-end="23">Based on my experience, this step can be a bit tricky, and you may encounter a few errors. First you may not be using the right pip. To ensure that you do, find pipâ€™s path in your virtual environment. For example, for me the path is the following:~/.conda/envs/RBFDQN_env/bin/pip. So I use the command:<br>
<strong>~/.conda/envs/RBFDQN_env/bin/pip install gym[all]==0.9.1</strong></p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="24" data-line-end="26">Additionally, you might get errors that have to do with your gcc. While I cannot recommend a one-size-fit-all solution, I found that running this command solved the problem in some cases:<br>
<strong>MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.13  ~/.conda/envs/RBFDQN_env/bin/pip install gym[all]==0.9.1</strong></p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="27" data-line-end="31">Finally, you need to install some additional python packages, namely Tensorflow, Keras, and tqdm:<br>
<strong>~/.conda/envs/RBFDQN_env/bin/pip install tensorflow==1.13.1</strong><br>
<strong>~/.conda/envs/RBFDQN_env/bin/pip install keras==2.1.2</strong><br>
<strong>~/.conda/envs/RBFDQN_env/bin/pip install tqdm</strong></p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="32" data-line-end="35">Congratulations! You are now ready to run RBFDQN. Use the following command to run RBFDQN on Pendulum. It may take a few seconds for learning to kick off.<br>
<strong>python <a href="http://RBFDQN.py">RBFDQN.py</a> --env Pendulum-v0 --seed 0</strong><br>
You can choose from various domains: Pendulum-v0, LunarLanderContinuous-v2, BipedalWalker-v2, Ant-v1, HalfCheetah-v1, Hopper-v1, InvertedDoublePendulum-v1, InvertedPendulum-v1, and Reacher-v1 .Also, unless you now what you are doing, seed number can be 0.</p>
