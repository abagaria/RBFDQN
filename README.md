I highly recommend using Anaconda for creating and managing virtual environments. You can download Anaconda distribution from [here](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section). Download and install the Python 3.7 version.<br />
<br />
We now need to create an Anaconda virtual environment. We also need to specify the version of Python used for our new environment. I strongly recommend using Python 3.5.6 for this project. I also recommend choosing a descriptive name for your virtual environment, such as RBFDQN_env. On Mac, open a terminal tab. You can create such a virtual environment using the following command:<br />
conda create -n RBFDQN_env python=3.5.6 anaconda <br />
<br />
Before installing Python packages, you need to install Mujoco. The first step is to download Mujoco itself from [here](https://www.roboti.us/index.html). I highly recommend that you download mjpro131. You need to create a folder using the following command:<br />
mkdir ~/.mujoco/ <br />
<br />
Now put mjpro131 in the mujoco folder you just created. Note that you also need to get a Mujoco key and put the key inside the mujoco folder. You can get the key using one of the several ways outlined [here](https://www.roboti.us/license.html).<br />
<br />
You now want to activate your Anaconda virtual environment, and install relevant packages. To do so, use the following command:<br />
source activate RBFDQN_env <br />
<br />
The last line on your terminal should now be starting with (RBFDQN_env). This tells you that the environment is activated. You can always deactivate the environment using the command:<br />
conda deactivate <br />
<br />
You now need to install Open AI Gym. To do so, use the following command:<br />
pip install gym[all]==0.9.1<br />
<br />
Based on my experience, this step can be a bit tricky, and you may encounter a few errors. First you may not be using the right pip. To ensure that you do, find pipâ€™s path in your virtual environment. For example, for me the path is the following:~/.conda/envs/RBFDQN_env/bin/pip. So I use the command:<br />
~/.conda/envs/RBFDQN_env/bin/pip install gym[all]==0.9.1 <br />
<br />
Additionally, you might get errors that have to do with your gcc. While I cannot recommend a one-size-fit-all solution, I found that running this command solved the problem in some cases:<br />
MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.13  ~/.conda/envs/RBFDQN_env/bin/pip install gym[all]==0.9.1 <br />
<br />
Finally, you need to install some additional python packages, namely Tensorflow, Keras, and tqdm:<br />
~/.conda/envs/RBFDQN_env/bin/pip install tensorflow==1.13.1 <br />
~/.conda/envs/RBFDQN_env/bin/pip install keras==2.1.2 <br />
~/.conda/envs/RBFDQN_env/bin/pip install tqdm <br />
<br />
Congratulations! You are now ready to run RBFDQN. Use the following command to run RBFDQN on Pendulum. It may take a few seconds for learning to kick off. <br />
python RBFDQN.py --env Pendulum-v0 --seed 0  <br />
<br />
You can choose from various domains: Pendulum-v0, LunarLanderContinuous-v2, BipedalWalker-v2, Ant-v1, HalfCheetah-v1, Hopper-v1, InvertedDoublePendulum-v1, InvertedPendulum-v1, and Reacher-v1 .Also, unless you now what you are doing, seed number can be 0. <br />
